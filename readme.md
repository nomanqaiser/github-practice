<!-- 1: his style guide gives you all the details you need on how to indent code, where to place braces and spaces, naming conventions, and much more. -->

<!-- 2. COMMENT AND DOCUMENT
When it comes to coding best practices, one habit that could help you is to start each function or method you create with a comment. In this comment, you can outline exactly what the function or method does, what its parameters are, and what it returns.  -->

<!-- 
3: When following the coding best practices, remember the DRY Principle. DRY stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself, and the DRY Principle states that “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.” This is also sometimes known as DIE: Duplication Is Evil.  -->


<!-- 4: TEST YOUR CODE AND RESPOND TO ERRORS
A vital coding best practice is to test your code -->

<!-- 5: is usually means about twenty-five to fifty lines of code. If you find your code is longer than fifty lines, split it up into shorter, more digestible sections.  -->

<!-- Readable code is easy to follow, optimizes space and time. Here are a few ways to achieve that:

Write as few lines as possible.
Use appropriate naming conventions.
Segment blocks of code in the same section into paragraphs.
Use indentation to marks the beginning and end of control structures. Clearly specify the code between them.
Don’t use lengthy functions. Ideally, a single function should carry out a single task.
Use the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. Automate repetitive tasks whenever necessary. The same piece of code should not be repeated in the script.
Avoid Deep Nesting. Too many nesting levels make code harder to read and follow.
Capitalize SQL special words and function names to distinguish them from table and column names.
Avoid long lines. It is easier for humans to read blocks of lines that are horizontally short and vertically long. -->


<!-- PHP itself is sometimes guilty of not following consistent naming schemes:

strpos() vs. str_split()
imagetypes() vs. image_type_to_extension()

First of all, the names should have word boundaries. There are two popular options:

camelCase: The first letter of each word is capitalized, except the first word, like parseRawImageData().
underscores: Underscores between words, like mysql_real_escape_string(). -->
